            <br />
            Key Technologies:
            <br />
            Blockchain Platform: Ethereum for smart contract deployment. Wallet
            Integration: MetaMask for user authentication and transactions. Ether.js:
            For interaction between the DApp and the blockchain. Frontend Framework:
            Next.js for the user interface. Smart Contract Language: Solidity. Token
            Standard: ERC-20 for governance tokens.
            <br />
            Milestones:
            <br />
            1. Project Initiation (1 week: Nov 4 - 10): Define project scope and
            goals. Assemble the development team. Select the blockchain platform and
            technologies.
            <br />
            2. DAO Creation and Membership Management (1 week: Nov 11 - 18 ): Develop
            DAO creation functionality. Implement member management, allowing users to
            join or leave DAOs.
            <br />
            3. User Authentication and Wallet Integration (1 week: ):
            <br />
            Secure user authentication with MetaMask. Enable seamless wallet
            integration for transactions.

            4. Proposal Management (1 week):
            <br />
            Implement a basic system for users to submit proposals. Allow for proposal
            tracking and visibility.
            <br />
            5. Voting System (1 week): Create a simple, transparent voting mechanism.
            Implement a basic majority voting system.
            <br />
            6. Smart Contract Development (1 week): Develop and deploy smart contracts
            for DAO governance. Ensure basic security and auditability.
            <br />
            7. Token Integration (1 week): Create or integrate a governance token
            (ERC-20). Implement basic token transfer functionality.
            <br />
            8. UI/UX Design (1 week):
            <br />
            Design a basic user interface for managing DAO memberships and voting
            history. Focus on usability and simplicity.
            <br />
            9. Testing and Bug Fixing (1 week): Thoroughly test the DApp to identify
            and fix critical bugs. Conduct limited user testing.
            <br />
            10. Deployment (1 week): Deploy the DApp on a testnet for initial testing.
            Prepare for mainnet deployment.
            <br />
            11. Documentation (1 week): Provide minimal documentation for users and
            developers. Include essential user guides and contract descriptions.
            <br />
            12. Compliance and Legal Assessment (1 week): Ensure basic compliance with
            local regulations and legal requirements.
            <br />
            13. Maintenance/Bug fixing: Maintenance through Smart contract
            upgradability.
